# SQL + Python Sentiment Analysis Using Database Retrieval
This folder contains an end-to-end Python project focused on connecting SQL databases with Python, retrieving sentiment data from a database, performing exploratory data analysis, training multiple Machine Learning models, and predicting sentiment classes.

The project demonstrates how structured sentiment datasets stored in SQL systems can be integrated into Python analytics workflows for classification and business intelligence.

### 1. Dataset
Contains source dataset file:
- testsentimentclass.csv

### 2. Scripts
Contains Python project files:
- Sql+python Sentiment Analysis.py

### 3. Database
Contains SQL / AWS RDS connection workflow documentation.

### 4. Reports
Contains charts, model outputs, accuracy summaries, and feature importance reports.

## Files Included

### 1. Sql+python Sentiment Analysis.py
Python script covering:
- Connecting Python with MySQL database using SQLAlchemy
- AWS RDS database integration
- Loading CSV data into DataFrame
- Retrieving structured sentiment data from SQL source
- Data exploration using Pandas
- Null value checks
- Descriptive statistics
- Correlation analysis
- Class distribution analysis
- Multiple Machine Learning model training
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score comparison
- Feature importance using Random Forest
- Data visualization and reporting

### 2. testsentimentclass.csv
Structured sentiment dataset transformed from text-based content into numerical features.
Each row represents a report, review, or text instance converted into measurable indicators.
Typical columns include:
- achievement
- approve
- growth
- increased
- reduction
- below
- Multiple sentiment keyword frequency features
- actual (Target Variable)

### Target Variable
- -1 = Negative Sentiment
- 0 = Neutral Sentiment
- 1 = Positive Sentiment
