# Travel Package Accepted / Rejected Prediction Using Python
This folder contains a Python end-to-end Machine Learning project focused on predicting whether a customer will accept or reject a travel package offer. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, multiple classification models, performance comparison, and actionable business insights for travel sales optimization.

### 1. Dataset
Contains raw dataset file:
- Travel.csv

### 2. Scripts
Contains Python project files:
- random_forest.py

### 3. Reports
Contains model outputs, confusion matrices, charts, accuracy reports, and business insights.

## Files Included

### 1. random_forest vs other_models.py
Python script covering:
- Loading CSV dataset using Pandas
- Missing value analysis
- Numerical missing value treatment using imputation
