# Tractor Sales Forecasting using Exponential Smoothing Methods

## Project Overview
This project focuses on **Time Series Forecasting** of tractor sales using **Exponential Smoothing Techniques** in **R**.
Three forecasting methods were applied:
- **Single Exponential Smoothing (SES)**
- **Double Exponential Smoothing (Holt’s Method)**
- **Triple Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters Method)**
The goal is to analyze historical tractor sales data, identify trend and seasonality, and forecast future sales accurately.

## Dataset Information
The dataset contains monthly tractor sales data.
| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Month / Time Period | Monthly observations |
| Sales | Tractor units sold |
The time series starts from:
- **January 2003**
With monthly frequency:
- **12 observations per year**

## Project Objectives
- Analyze historical tractor sales trends
- Detect seasonality patterns
- Build forecasting models
- Compare smoothing techniques
- Predict future tractor sales

## Libraries Used

### 1. Data Loading & Visualization
Imported tractor sales dataset and created line plots to understand movement over time.
Used:
plot()
ts()
Generated:
* Basic line chart
* Monthly sales trend chart
  
### 2. Time Series Conversion
Converted sales data into time series format:
ts(data, frequency = 12, start = c(2003,1))
This enables monthly forecasting analysis.

### 3. Seasonal Analysis
Used:
ggseasonplot()
monthplot()
To identify:
* Repeating seasonal patterns
* Strong and weak months
* Year-over-year sales movement

### 4. Time Series Decomposition
Used Multiplicative Decomposition:
decompose(type = "multiplicative")

Separated sales into:
* Trend
* Seasonality
* Irregular components

### 5. Train-Test Split
Data divided into:
| Dataset      | Period      |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| Training Set | 2003 - 2012 |
| Testing Set  | 2013 - 2014 |
Used to validate forecast accuracy.

## Forecasting Models Applied

### 1. Single Exponential Smoothing (SES)
Best for:
* No trend
* No seasonality
Used:
ses()

### 2. Double Exponential Smoothing (Holt’s Method)
Best for:
* Trend present
* No seasonality

Used:
holt()

### 3. Triple Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters)
Best for:
* Trend present
* Seasonality present
Used:
hw(seasonal = "multiplicative")
This is most suitable for tractor sales data.

## Model Evaluation
Forecasted values were compared against actual test data using:
accuracy()

Common metrics:
* RMSE
* MAE
* MAPE
* Forecast Error

## Visualization Outputs
Generated:
* Historical Sales Trend
* Seasonal Plot
* Polar Seasonal Plot
* Monthly Plot
* Decomposition Plot
* Forecast Plots
* Actual vs Predicted Comparison

## Key Insights
* Tractor sales show clear seasonal behavior.
* Trend exists over years.
* Triple Exponential Smoothing performs best when seasonality is strong.
* Forecasting helps inventory and production planning.

## Business Use Cases
Useful for:
* Tractor manufacturers
* Agricultural equipment distributors
* Supply chain planning
* Demand forecasting
* Production scheduling
* Revenue planning

## Project Files
| File Name         | Description                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Tractor Data.R    | Complete forecasting code in R |
| Tractor-Sales.csv | Monthly tractor sales dataset  |

## How to Run
1. Open R / RStudio
2. Install required libraries
3. Load CSV file
4. Run `Tractor Data.R`
5. Review plots, forecasts, and accuracy metrics

## Key Learnings
* Time Series Analysis in R
* Forecasting using SES, Holt, Holt-Winters
* Trend & Seasonality Detection
* Model Accuracy Comparison
* Business Demand Forecasting

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates practical forecasting of tractor sales using Exponential Smoothing methods. Among all methods, **Triple Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters)** is generally the most effective when both trend and seasonality exist.
